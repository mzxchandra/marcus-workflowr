<h1>Week 7</h1>

<p>Task: Go through FDA drug targets list and understand if they are MDD relevant. Prioritize gene2s that show up in several COTA analyses.</p>

<p>I wrote a script to get the drug descriptions from PubChem given the drug names. Then I passed each description to a LLM to assign whether or not the drug is MDD relevant. I have a CSV here now with all the gene drug interactions and columns with the description of the drug and whether or not it's MDD relevant (most are not) <code>COTA_gene_drug_investigation</code>.</p>

<p>Designed a Fisher test to see if COTA core genes were more likely to be FDA drug targets (any type of drugs).</p>

<p>Observed overlap (# COTA gene2s that are FDA targets) = 60</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Odds ratio 1.158 (COTA core genes 15.8% more likely to be drug targets)</li>
<li>P value = 0.17 (not significant)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using the sampling method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>normal_p_value = 0.1726 → 17.3% probability of seeing an overlap as large or larger than 60 by chance.</li>
<li>empirical_p_value = 0.1838 → in ~18.4% of random trials, the overlap was ≥ 60.</li>
</ul>
